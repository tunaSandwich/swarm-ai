# Project Overview: AI-Driven Connectivity Maintenance for Drone Swarm Simulation

## Project Title
AI-Driven Connectivity Maintenance for a Drone Swarm Simulation

## Goal
To create a focused simulation demonstrating how a small swarm of drones (target: 15-30) can autonomously position themselves to maximize network connectivity **amongst themselves** using AI/ML techniques (specifically Reinforcement Learning or Swarm Intelligence approaches). This project serves as a targeted proof-of-concept related to broader challenges in drone mesh networking.

## Primary Objective
Visually and statistically demonstrate the swarm's ability to dynamically adapt positions to establish and maintain communication links within the group. The simulation should show emergent self-organizing behavior, potentially reacting to challenges such as:
*   Varying initial node densities or distributions.
*   Simple energy depletion models affecting drone movement or availability.
*   Simulated removal of individual nodes to test network resilience.

## Target Audience for Output
*(**User Note:** Please replace the placeholder below with the specific person/role you aim to impress)*

The primary audience for the final simulation and report is **[e.g., Lead Engineer, Dr. Smith / Hiring Manager at Company Y / Colleague working on Project X]**. The purpose is to showcase relevant technical skills (AI/ML, swarm behavior logic, simulation development, data analysis) and insightful thinking about autonomous network management, potentially highlighting suitability for opportunities related to their larger, more complex drone network project.

## Deliverable
1.  **Functional Simulation:** Executable code (likely Python) that runs the simulation. Should visually display drone positions and active communication links in real-time or step-by-step.
2.  **Results Visualization:** Graphs generated from simulation runs, showing key metrics over time (e.g., chosen connectivity metric, average drone energy, number of active links).
3.  **Concise Report:** A short document (~3-5 pages) summarizing:
    *   Project Goal & Scope
    *   Methodology (AI algorithm choice, state/action/reward or fitness function, simulation model details)
    *   Simulation Setup & Parameters
    *   Results (including visualizations)
    *   Discussion (insights, limitations, potential next steps)
    *   Conclusion

## Technology Focus
*   **Core Development:** Simulation environment built primarily in Python.
*   **Libraries:** Utilizing libraries such as NumPy (for numerical operations), NetworkX (for graph analysis/connectivity metrics), and potentially Pygame or Matplotlib (for visualization).
*   **AI/ML:** Implementation and tuning of the chosen AI/ML algorithm (e.g., Q-learning, DQN, PSO adaptation) for decentralized drone control.
