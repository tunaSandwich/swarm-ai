# Project Overview: AI-Driven Drone Corridor Formation Simulation

## Project Title
AI-Driven Drone Corridor Formation Simulation (or: Swarm Sim: Corridor Network)

## Goal
To create a simulation demonstrating how a swarm of drones (target: 15-30+) can autonomously position themselves to form a **robust communication corridor** between a defined **Start Point** and **End Point**. The corridor aims to provide sufficient density and internal connectivity to support resilient data relay, reflecting needs for handling redirected internet data.

## Primary Objective
Visually and statistically demonstrate the swarm's ability to self-organize into a "thick path" or corridor structure. The simulation should show drones:
*   Aligning generally along the axis between the Start and End points.
*   Maintaining a target **density** within a defined **corridor width**.
*   Establishing and maintaining **redundant communication links** with multiple neighbors (ahead, behind, sideways) within the corridor.
*   Dynamically adapting positions to maintain the corridor structure, potentially reacting to energy depletion or simulated node removal.

## Target Audience for Output
*(**User Note:** Please replace the placeholder below with the specific person/role you aim to impress)*

The primary audience for the final simulation and report is for a technical potential business worker. The purpose is to showcase relevant technical skills (AI/ML for complex multi-agent coordination, swarm behavior, simulation development, data analysis) and insightful thinking about creating resilient, autonomous network structures.

## Deliverable
1.  **Functional Simulation:** Executable code (Python) running the simulation. Should visually display drone positions, active links, and the emergent corridor structure.
2.  **Results Visualization:** Graphs and potentially animations/screenshots showing:
    *   The swarm forming and maintaining the corridor.
    *   Metrics over time (e.g., average drone distance from the Start-End centerline, average local density within the corridor, path continuity metrics).
    *   Energy usage patterns.
3.  **Concise Report:** A short document (~3-5 pages) summarizing:
    *   Project Goal (corridor formation) & Scope.
    *   Methodology (AI algorithm choice tailored for corridor formation, simulation model, corridor parameters like width/density targets).
    *   Simulation Setup & Parameters.
    *   Results (visual and quantitative evidence of corridor formation and its properties).
    *   Discussion (insights, challenges of corridor formation, limitations, potential next steps).
    *   Conclusion.

## Technology Focus
*   **Core Development:** Simulation environment built primarily in Python.
*   **Libraries:** Utilizing libraries such as NumPy, NetworkX (for connectivity analysis within the corridor), Matplotlib/Pygame (for visualization), and potentially AI/ML libraries if needed beyond custom implementation.
*   **AI/ML:** Implementation and tuning of AI/ML algorithms (e.g., RL or SI) specifically designed to achieve the collective corridor formation behavior based on local interactions.
