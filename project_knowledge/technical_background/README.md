# Technical Background

This directory contains documents detailing the core technical concepts, algorithms, and models relevant to the "AI-Driven Connectivity Maintenance for Drone Swarm Simulation" project.

These files provide foundational knowledge for the AI assistant and serve as reference points during development.

**Contents:**

*   `Connectivity_Metrics.md`: Explains how network connectivity will be measured.
*   `Positioning_Algorithms.md`: Details the AI/ML approaches (RL, SI) for drone positioning.
*   `Simulation_Model.md`: Defines the rules and models of the simulation environment (physics, energy, comms).
*   `Simulation_Tools.md`: (Optional) Lists potential software libraries and tools.
