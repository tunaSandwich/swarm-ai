# Project Deliverables: AI Drone Connectivity Simulation

This document outlines the expected final outputs for the "AI-Driven Connectivity Maintenance Simulation" project (referred to as "Swarm Sim"). These deliverables are intended to effectively demonstrate the project's achievements to the target audience mentioned in `Project_Overview.md`.

**1. Simulation Code:**

*   **Description:** The complete, executable Python source code for the simulation.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Should be reasonably well-commented, explaining key sections and logic.
    *   Includes clear instructions on how to set up the environment (e.g., a `requirements.txt` file) and run the simulation.
    *   Implements the core components defined in `Simulation_Model.md`.
    *   Includes the chosen AI positioning algorithm (RL or SI).
    *   Should be runnable to produce the visualizations and results described below.

**2. Simulation Visualization:**

*   **Description:** A visual representation of the simulation in action.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Displays drone positions within the environment boundaries.
    *   Clearly shows active communication links between drones based on `COMM_RANGE`.
    *   Updates dynamically as the simulation progresses (either real-time via Pygame or as an animation via Matplotlib).
    *   *(Optional but Recommended):* Visually indicates drone state (e.g., color change for low energy).
*   **Format:** Either runnable directly from the code or provided as short video recordings/GIFs of key simulation behaviors (e.g., swarm organizing, reacting to node removal).

**3. Results Data & Graphs:**

*   **Description:** Quantitative results demonstrating the performance and behavior of the swarm.
*   **Requirements:** Data logged during simulation runs and plotted using Matplotlib or a similar library. Key graphs should include:
    *   **Connectivity Metric vs. Time:** Plotting the chosen primary metric (e.g., LCC Size, Average Node Degree) over the simulation duration.
    *   **Energy Metric vs. Time:** Plotting the average remaining energy of the swarm over time.
    *   *(Optional):* Plotting the number of active drones vs. time (if node removal is implemented).
    *   *(Optional):* Histograms or distributions of node degrees at different time points.
*   **Format:** Image files (e.g., PNG) for the plots, potentially raw data files (e.g., CSV) if desired.

**4. Final Report:**

*   **Description:** A concise document (~3-5 pages) summarizing the project.
*   **Requirements:** Structured clearly, covering the following sections:
    *   **Introduction:** Problem statement (connectivity maintenance), project goal, defined scope (referencing key limitations from `Project_Scope.md`).
    *   **Methodology:** Description of the simulation model (energy, comms, movement), details of the chosen AI/ML algorithm (state/action/reward for RL or fitness/update for SI), connectivity metric(s) used.
    *   **Simulation Setup:** Key parameters used for the presented results (number of drones, area size, `COMM_RANGE`, energy values, AI parameters).
    *   **Results:** Presentation of the key graphs and visualizations, accompanied by descriptions of the observed swarm behavior (e.g., how connectivity improved, how the swarm reacted to energy depletion).
    *   **Discussion:** Interpretation of the results (did the AI achieve the goal?), limitations of the current simulation, potential challenges encountered, and suggestions for future improvements or next steps (briefly linking back to the larger context if appropriate).
    *   **Conclusion:** A brief summary of the project's achievements and key findings.
*   **Format:** PDF document.

These four components together constitute the complete deliverables for this focused proof-of-concept project.
